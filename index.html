                    "The Gold and Wooden Halls" is a stylelish, golden and beautyfull conglomaration of rich house leaving rooms, enlighted by those stylelish and circular chandlears, and only by them, as the windows aways look out to an eternal darkness(wich is actually a way to <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 6</a>, if you jump out). They are liminal, they are chic, they present random <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/object-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almond water</a> bottles displayed on tables and counches for you to maintain your hidration while appreciating their infinite beauty. Make sure not to forget about food ninwhile, or you <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might know what will happen</a>.

                "The Guardian" is a level exclusive and single exemplar entity that flyes around this level, takes a similar apearence to Frontrooms' aow cubs wears this pendant on its sholder. It can talk, remember and think just like humans(so is that true that itself asked to be called "The Guardian"), and claims to be a protector of "The skyblue tresure from the ancient times", an item it refuses to explain M.E.G. about, claiming "Humanity is not trustble enough to hear about something so important". The Guardian does never atack people who are just wandering aimlessly, having still shon agrssion only twords those who atack it first. If politly treated, The Guardian can be a nice creature to talk to, though it tends not to say many things. The Guardian has confirmed that this pendant it wears is the key for accessing the skyblue tresure from the ancient times, but no attemps on taking it have been done opr are planned by the M.E.G., of wich the members are not aquaring a divine aow ripping their faces off at the current moment.

<h2>Entrances</h2>
<li>Wooden gates found in <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> lead here, they desapear when who crossed them looks away</li>
<li>Golden gates might randomly apear in victorian era styled levels, they all work just like those discribed above</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
<h2>Exits</h2>
<li>Rarely, a fully desctroyed and abandoned leaving room can be found in the middle of the stylish ones. No-cliping in one takes to abandoned house themed levels</li>
<li>No-cpliping trough a flickering chandlear sends to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></li>
<li>No-cpliping trough ocasionally apearing great statues of musculy worriors leads to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></li>
<li>No-cpliping into ocasionally apearing globes leads to jumping out of a globe in <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 58</a></li>
